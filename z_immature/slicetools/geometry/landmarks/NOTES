how to represent stim sites / stim grids?

Can do it all as a stim grid, including 1 by 1 sites.

Each stimgrid will have a name
	Each stim site within stimgrid needs some sort of reference
	We already have a set of reference names in our old recordings
	
	How do we identify points to be included in a stimgrid?
		5) User enters dimensions of grid (M spots tall by N spots wide) and clicks around the grid; sites are interpolated
		1) User enters step size in X and Y and clicks around the grid to determine number of points
		4) User enters step size, number of points, and clicks on the center location
		3) User manually enters a list of locations
		2) User clicks locations on the screen to generate a list of locations

	*Option 1:
		Label each site with a number string START and INC, go by columns then by rows
			Then reference is grid1:1.5, e.g.

	Option 2:
		Allow user to label each site in his or her own way
			Too complicated?  If user wants this, they can use multiple stimgrids

	Drawing:
		Black line with points marked by X's  (good for single row)
		Line grid where centers correspond to stimulated points (good for 2 x 2 or greater)
