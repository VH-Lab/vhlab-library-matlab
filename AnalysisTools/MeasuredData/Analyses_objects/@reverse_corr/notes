replace this computation with singleunit_rc (which needs to be extended for color)

the continuous waveform should really just be a high resolution reverse-correlation (0.1ms time scale)

should have the ability to pull up a raster for the forward correlation

should be able to calculate based on different features besides linear; such as "absolute value of change"
