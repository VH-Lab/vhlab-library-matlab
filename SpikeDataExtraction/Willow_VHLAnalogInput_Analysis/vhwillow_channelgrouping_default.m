% VHWILLOW_CHANNELGROUPING - Describes the vhwillow_channelgrouping.txt file for multichannel analysis
%
%   In each directory that contains data that was recorded by the Willow
%   multichannel analog input program, there should be a file
%   called "vhwillow_channelgroupings.txt" that describes how signals should
%   be grouped for spike waveform analysis.
%
%   It should have the following format:
%
%   The first line should contain the text 'name', followed by a tab, followed
%   by 'ref', followed by a tab, followed by the word 'channel_list',
%   followed by a carriage return and/or linefeed.
%
%   Each subsequent line should contain a name/reference pair and a list of
%   channels that correspond to that name/reference pair.
%
%   Example:
%
%   Line 1:   name<tab>ref<tab>channel_list
%   Line 2:   extra<tab>1<tab>[1 2]
%   Line 3:   extra2<tab>1<tab>[3]
%
%   This indicates that channels 1 and 2 should be grouped, and that they correspond
%   to records with name 'extra' and reference 1.  Further, channel 3 should be considered alone, and they
%   correspond to name 'extra2' and reference number 1.
%
%   This file can be read by the function LOADSTRUCTARRAY

s = [];

for i=1:128, 
	ns = struct('name',['extra' int2str(i)],'ref',1,'channel_list',i);
	if isempty(s),
		s = ns;
	else,
		s(end+1) = ns;
	end;
end;
