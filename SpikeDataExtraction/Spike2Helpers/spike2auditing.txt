Issues:

need to know more about the 0 point of extracted spikes from spike2

Should we only audit spikes from clusters that are in our dataset?  that would save time...

How should we audit across directories?  The non-cell clusters will be different from directory to directory.

How should we express the "answer?"  (Probably by editing the cell's associate)

Should we have an opportunity to re-do the analysis?  Not initially, let's just see what we have

% assume 


spike2auditclusters(ds,name,ref,indexes)
